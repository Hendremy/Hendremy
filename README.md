Hi ! 
I'm Rémy, a student at HELMo in Liège, Belgium starting my 3rd and final year of a bachelor in Software Development.
I'm sharing the finished projects I had the chance to make as part of the evaluations at my school and the projects I'm coding on my free time to explore.

Currently giving Python a try.
