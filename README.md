Hi ! 
I'm RÃ©my, I just graduated from a bachelor's degree in Software Engineering and now I'm starting a master's degree in computer systems architecture.
I'm sharing the finished projects I had the chance to make as part of the evaluations at my school and the projects I'm coding on my free time to explore.
